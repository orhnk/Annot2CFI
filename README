Annot2CFI
========

A tool to convert annotations to CFI by searching the e-book. Easily portable any other e-reader or program than kobo and foliate (PR).

Usage
-----

  node index.js <KoboReader.sqlite> # Kobo

  node search-epub.js <mybook.epub> <query> # Shell Query (May be outdated)


Algo
----

1. Generate CFI for each paragraph using epub-cfi-generator
2. Search from the paragrahs and find the corresponding CFI


Problems
--------

- The CFI generator used for this project is not fully compatible with foliate e-book reader program: CFI generator is treating every text node as /1 to be more specific.
